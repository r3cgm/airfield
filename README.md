Hello.

This code drives the Airfield project @ ledseq.com.

It will not be useful unless you own one of our Airfield kits, which
unfortunately are out of stock and discontinued.

PCB schematic, layout, BOM, and Gerber files are included in this repository.
You can also [order the PCB from OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/KDWBtbnK).

If anyone ever actually uses this repo to update their kit, please drop us a
line at ledseq@ledseq.com
